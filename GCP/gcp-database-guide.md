## 🔹 Availability & Durability

### Understanding the 9's

```yaml
# Availability Metrics:
99.9% (3 9's):    8.77 hours downtime/year
99.99% (4 9's):   52.6 minutes downtime/year  # Standard target
99.999% (5 9's):  5.26 minutes downtime/year  # High availability
99.9999% (6 9's): 31.5 seconds downtime/year  # Mission critical

# Durability Metrics:
99.999999999% (11 9's): Lose 1 file per 10M files over 10M years
```

### Availability Strategies

```yaml
# Multi-Zone Deployment:
Primary Zone: us-central1-a
Secondary Zone: us-central1-b
Benefit: Protection against zone failures
RTO: 1-5 minutes (automatic failover)

# Multi-Region Deployment:
Primary Region: us-central1
Secondary Region: us-east1
Benefit: Protection against regional disasters
RTO: 5-30 minutes (manual or automatic)

# Global Distribution:
Regions: us-central1, europe-west1, asia-southeast1
Benefit: Low latency worldwide + disaster recovery
RTO: Varies by implementation
```

### Durability Implementation

```yaml
# Data Protection Layers:
1. Local Redundancy: Multiple disk copies in same zone
2. Zonal Redundancy: Copies across zones in region
3. Regional Redundancy: Copies across regions
4. Backup Strategy: Point-in-time recovery
5. Archive Strategy: Long-term retention

# Example: Cloud SQL HA Configuration
Primary Instance: us-central1-a
Standby Instance: us-central1-b
Automated Backups: Daily + transaction logs
Cross-Region Replicas: us-east1 (disaster recovery)
```

## 🔹 RTO & RPO Concepts

### Recovery Objectives Explained

```yaml
# RTO (Recovery Time Objective):
Definition: Maximum acceptable downtime
Measurement: Time to restore service after failure
Business Impact: Revenue loss, SLA violations

# RPO (Recovery Point Objective):
Definition: Maximum acceptable data loss
Measurement: Time between last backup and failure
Business Impact: Lost transactions, compliance issues
```

### RTO/RPO Implementation Matrix

| Scenario | RTO Target | RPO Target | GCP Solution | Cost |
|----------|------------|------------|--------------|------|
| **Mission Critical** | < 1 minute | < 1 minute | Spanner Multi-Region | $$$$$ |
| **High Availability** | < 5 minutes | < 5 minutes | Cloud SQL HA + Read Replicas | $$$$ |
| **Standard Production** | < 15 minutes | < 15 minutes | Cloud SQL Regional + Backups | $$$ |
| **Development** | < 1 hour | < 1 hour | Single Instance + Daily Backups | $$ |
| **Archive/Reporting** | < 4 hours | < 24 hours | BigQuery + Cloud Storage | $ |

### Practical RTO/RPO Scenarios

## 🔹 Database Consistency Models

### Consistency Types

```yaml
# Strong Consistency (ACID):
Guarantee: All reads receive the most recent write
Use Case: Financial transactions, inventory management
GCP Services: Cloud Spanner, Cloud SQL
Trade-off: Higher latency, lower availability

# Eventual Consistency:
Guarantee: System will become consistent over time
Use Case: Social media posts, content distribution
GCP Services: Firestore, BigTable
Trade-off: Lower latency, higher availability

# Read-After-Write Consistency:
Guarantee: Users see their own writes immediately
Use Case: User profiles, personal data
GCP Services: Firestore (with proper configuration)
Trade-off: Balanced approach
```

### CAP Theorem in Practice

```yaml
# CAP Theorem: Choose 2 of 3
Consistency: All nodes see same data simultaneously
Availability: System remains operational
Partition Tolerance: System continues despite network failures

# GCP Service Classifications:
Cloud Spanner: CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)
- Strong consistency across regions
- May sacrifice availability during network partitions

Cloud SQL: CA (Consistency + Availability)
- Strong consistency within region
- Limited partition tolerance (single region)

Firestore: AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)
- Eventually consistent
- Highly available across partitions
```

## 🔹 Caching Strategies

### Memorystore (Redis/Memcached)

```yaml
# Service Tiers:
Basic Tier:
- Single node
- No replication
- 99.9% availability SLA
- Lower cost
- Use for: Development, caching

Standard Tier:
- Primary + replica nodes
- Automatic failover
- 99.9% availability SLA
- Cross-zone replication
- Use for: Production applications

# Capacity Planning:
Memory Sizing:
- Monitor cache hit ratio (target > 95%)
- Plan for peak usage + 20% buffer
- Consider data growth over time
- Account for Redis overhead (~25%)

Network Bandwidth:
- Monitor network utilization
- Consider read/write patterns
- Plan for traffic spikes
- Use VPC peering for optimal performance
```

### Caching Patterns

```yaml
# Cache-Aside Pattern:
Application Logic:
1. Check cache for data
2. If cache miss, query database
3. Store result in cache
4. Return data to user

Use Case: Read-heavy workloads
Benefits: Simple implementation, cache failures don't break app
Drawbacks: Cache misses cause latency spikes

# Write-Through Pattern:
Application Logic:
1. Write data to cache
2. Write data to database
3. Return success to user

Use Case: Write-heavy workloads with read requirements
Benefits: Data consistency, cache always up-to-date
Drawbacks: Higher write latency

# Write-Behind Pattern:
Application Logic:
1. Write data to cache
2. Return success to user
3. Asynchronously write to database

Use Case: High-throughput writes
Benefits: Low write latency
Drawbacks: Risk of data loss, complexity

# Cache Invalidation Strategies:
TTL (Time To Live):
- Set expiration time for cache entries
- Good for data that changes predictably
- Simple to implement

Event-Based Invalidation:
- Invalidate cache when data changes
- Use Pub/Sub for distributed invalidation
- More complex but more efficient

Version-Based Invalidation:
- Include version number in cache keys
- Increment version on data changes
- Allows gradual cache updates
```

### Caching Best Practices

```yaml
# Cache Key Design:
Naming Convention: service:entity:id:version
Examples:
- user:profile:12345:v2
- product:details:abc123:v1
- session:data:xyz789:v1

Benefits:
- Easy to understand and debug
- Supports versioning
- Enables bulk operations
- Facilitates monitoring

# Cache Monitoring:
Key Metrics:
- Hit ratio (target > 95%)
- Memory utilization (target < 80%)
- Eviction rate
- Connection count
- Response time

Alerting:
- Hit ratio < 90%: Review cache strategy
- Memory > 85%: Scale up or optimize
- High eviction rate: Increase memory or TTL
- Connection issues: Check network/security

# Cache Security:
Network Security:
- Use private IP addresses
- Implement VPC firewall rules
- Enable AUTH for Redis
- Use SSL/TLS for data in transit

Access Control:
- Implement IAM roles
- Use service accounts
- Regular access reviews
- Monitor access patterns
