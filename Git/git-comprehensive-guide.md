## ðŸ”¹ Git Fundamentals & Architecture

### Understanding Git's Distributed Nature

**Git vs Centralized VCS:**
Git fundamentally differs from centralized version control systems like SVN or Perforce. In centralized systems, there's a single source of truth - the central server. If the server goes down, no one can commit, view history, or collaborate. Git, being distributed, means every clone is a complete repository with full history.

**Key Architectural Concepts:**

**1. The Three Trees:**
Git operates on three main areas that form the foundation of its workflow:

- **Working Directory**: Your actual files on disk where you make changes
- **Staging Area (Index)**: A intermediate area where you prepare commits
- **Repository (.git directory)**: Where Git stores metadata and object database

**2. Git Objects:**
Git stores everything as objects in a content-addressable filesystem:

- **Blob Objects**: Store file contents (identified by SHA-1 hash of content)
- **Tree Objects**: Store directory structures and file permissions
- **Commit Objects**: Store commit metadata (author, timestamp, parent commits)
- **Tag Objects**: Store tag information and references

**3. References (Refs):**
Git uses references to point to specific commits:

- **Branches**: Movable pointers to commits (stored in `.git/refs/heads/`)
- **Tags**: Fixed pointers to commits (stored in `.git/refs/tags/`)
- **HEAD**: Special pointer to current branch/commit (stored in `.git/HEAD`)

### Git's Content Addressing System

Git uses SHA-1 hashing to create unique identifiers for all objects. This provides several benefits:

**Data Integrity**: Any corruption is immediately detectable because the hash won't match
**Deduplication**: Identical content is stored only once across the entire repository
**Distributed Consistency**: The same content will have the same hash across all repositories

### Understanding Git's Graph Structure

Git history is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where:
- Each commit points to its parent(s)
- Merge commits have multiple parents
- The graph structure enables powerful operations like finding common ancestors

## ðŸ”¹ Repository Management

### Repository Initialization and Configuration

**Local Repository Setup:**
When you initialize a Git repository, Git creates the `.git` directory structure:

```
.git/
â”œâ”€â”€ config          # Repository-specific configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ description     # Repository description for GitWeb
â”œâ”€â”€ HEAD           # Points to current branch
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/         # Client and server-side hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ info/          # Global exclude file
â”œâ”€â”€ objects/       # Object database (blobs, trees, commits, tags)
â””â”€â”€ refs/          # References (branches, tags, remotes)
```

**Configuration Hierarchy:**
Git configuration follows a three-level hierarchy:

1. **System Level** (`/etc/gitconfig`): Affects all users and repositories
2. **Global Level** (`~/.gitconfig`): Affects all repositories for current user
3. **Local Level** (`.git/config`): Affects only current repository

**Essential Configuration for DevOps:**
```bash
# Identity (required for commits)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@company.com"

# Default branch name
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Editor for commit messages
git config --global core.editor "vim"

# Merge tool for conflicts
git config --global merge.tool vimdiff

# Push behavior
git config --global push.default simple

# Credential caching
git config --global credential.helper cache

# Line ending handling (important for cross-platform teams)
git config --global core.autocrlf input  # Linux/Mac
git config --global core.autocrlf true   # Windows
```

### Remote Repository Management

**Understanding Remotes:**
Remotes are references to other repositories, typically hosted on servers. They enable collaboration and backup.

**Remote Tracking Branches:**
When you clone a repository, Git creates remote tracking branches (e.g., `origin/main`) that track the state of branches in the remote repository. These are read-only local references that update when you fetch from the remote.

**Fetch vs Pull:**
- **Fetch**: Downloads objects and refs from remote but doesn't merge
- **Pull**: Fetch + merge (or rebase with `--rebase` flag)

Understanding this distinction is crucial for maintaining clean history and avoiding unexpected merges.

### Repository Maintenance

**Garbage Collection:**
Git automatically runs garbage collection to optimize repository size:
- Removes unreachable objects
- Compresses object database
- Packs loose objects into packfiles

**Repository Health Checks:**
```bash
# Check repository integrity
git fsck --full

# Show repository statistics
git count-objects -v

# Manual garbage collection
git gc --aggressive --prune=now
```

## ðŸ”¹ Branching Strategies & Workflows

### Understanding Branching Models

**Git Flow:**
A branching model that defines specific branch types and their purposes:

- **main/master**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/***: Individual feature development
- **release/***: Release preparation
- **hotfix/***: Critical production fixes

**Pros:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Supports parallel development
- Well-defined release process

**Cons:**
- Complex for small teams
- Can lead to merge conflicts
- Slower integration cycle

**GitHub Flow:**
A simplified workflow focusing on main branch and feature branches:

- **main**: Always deployable
- **feature branches**: Short-lived branches for features/fixes
- **Pull requests**: Code review and discussion before merge

**Pros:**
- Simple and easy to understand
- Encourages continuous deployment
- Faster feedback cycles

**Cons:**
- Less suitable for scheduled releases
- Requires robust CI/CD pipeline
- May not suit complex release cycles

**GitLab Flow:**
Combines Git Flow and GitHub Flow with environment branches:

- **main**: Development integration
- **pre-production**: Staging environment
- **production**: Production environment

### Branch Protection and Policies

**Branch Protection Rules:**
Modern Git platforms support branch protection to enforce quality gates:

- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict who can push to protected branches
- Require signed commits

**Example Branch Policy Configuration:**
```yaml
# .github/branch-protection.yml
protection_rules:
  main:
    required_status_checks:
      strict: true
      contexts:
        - "ci/build"
        - "ci/test"
        - "security/scan"
    enforce_admins: true
    required_pull_request_reviews:
      required_approving_review_count: 2
      dismiss_stale_reviews: true
      require_code_owner_reviews: true
    restrictions:
      users: []
      teams: ["senior-developers"]
```

### Feature Branch Workflow

**Best Practices for Feature Branches:**

1. **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names with prefixes
   - `feature/user-authentication`
   - `bugfix/login-validation`
   - `hotfix/security-patch`

2. **Branch Lifecycle**: Keep branches short-lived (ideally < 1 week)

3. **Regular Synchronization**: Frequently rebase or merge from main branch

4. **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change

---

## ðŸ”¹ Merge Strategies & Conflict Resolution

### Understanding Merge Types

**Fast-Forward Merge:**
When the target branch hasn't diverged from the source branch, Git can simply move the branch pointer forward. This creates a linear history.

**When it happens:**
- No new commits on target branch since branching
- Results in linear history
- No merge commit created

**Three-Way Merge:**
When both branches have diverged, Git creates a merge commit with two parents.

**Process:**
1. Find common ancestor of both branches
2. Compare changes from ancestor to each branch tip
3. Automatically merge non-conflicting changes
4. Flag conflicts for manual resolution

**Merge Strategies:**

**Recursive Strategy (Default):**
- Handles most merge scenarios
- Automatically resolves simple conflicts
- Creates merge commits for complex merges

**Octopus Strategy:**
- For merging multiple branches simultaneously
- Only works if no manual conflict resolution needed
- Rarely used in practice

**Ours/Theirs Strategy:**
- Ignores changes from one side completely
- Useful for specific scenarios like reverting merges

### Conflict Resolution Deep Dive

**Understanding Conflict Markers:**
```
<<<<<<< HEAD (Current Change)
Your changes
=======
Their changes
>>>>>>> branch-name (Incoming Change)
```

**Types of Conflicts:**

1. **Content Conflicts**: Same lines modified differently
2. **Rename Conflicts**: File renamed differently in both branches
3. **Delete/Modify Conflicts**: File deleted in one branch, modified in another
4. **Mode Conflicts**: File permissions changed differently

**Advanced Conflict Resolution:**

**Using Merge Tools:**
Git supports various merge tools for visual conflict resolution:
- vimdiff, meld, kdiff3, p4merge, Beyond Compare

**Three-Way Merge Understanding:**
- **Base**: Common ancestor version
- **Local**: Your changes (HEAD)
- **Remote**: Their changes (incoming branch)

**Conflict Resolution Strategies:**

1. **Manual Resolution**: Edit files to resolve conflicts
2. **Take Ours**: `git checkout --ours filename`
3. **Take Theirs**: `git checkout --theirs filename`
4. **Abort Merge**: `git merge --abort`

### Rebase vs Merge Philosophy

**Merge Approach:**
- Preserves complete history
- Shows when features were integrated
- Creates merge commits
- Non-destructive operation

**Rebase Approach:**
- Creates linear history
- Rewrites commit history
- No merge commits
- Can lose context of when features were integrated

**When to Use Each:**

**Use Merge When:**
- Working on public/shared branches
- Want to preserve complete history
- Multiple developers working on same feature
- Need to maintain audit trail

**Use Rebase When:**
- Cleaning up local commits before pushing
- Maintaining linear history
- Working on private feature branches
- Integrating upstream changes

**Golden Rule of Rebasing:**
Never rebase commits that have been pushed to a shared repository and might be used by others.

## ðŸ”¹ Advanced Git Operations

### Interactive Rebase Mastery

**Interactive rebase** is one of Git's most powerful features for cleaning up commit history:

**Common Use Cases:**
1. **Squashing commits**: Combine multiple commits into one
2. **Reordering commits**: Change the sequence of commits
3. **Editing commits**: Modify commit messages or content
4. **Splitting commits**: Break one commit into multiple
5. **Dropping commits**: Remove commits entirely

**Rebase Commands:**
- `pick`: Use commit as-is
- `reword`: Use commit but edit message
- `edit`: Use commit but stop for amending
- `squash`: Combine with previous commit
- `fixup`: Like squash but discard commit message
- `drop`: Remove commit entirely

**Best Practices for Interactive Rebase:**
- Only rebase private commits
- Create backup branches before complex rebases
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and logical

### Cherry-Picking and Patch Management

**Cherry-picking** allows you to apply specific commits from one branch to another:

**When to Use Cherry-Pick:**
- Applying hotfixes to multiple branches
- Selectively bringing features forward
- Fixing commits that went to wrong branch

**Cherry-Pick Strategies:**
- Single commit: `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`
- Range of commits: `git cherry-pick <start>..<end>`
- Without committing: `git cherry-pick -n <commit-hash>`

### Stashing and Temporary Storage

**Git Stash** provides temporary storage for uncommitted changes:

**Stash Use Cases:**
- Switching branches with uncommitted changes
- Pulling updates with local modifications
- Temporarily storing experimental changes
- Context switching between tasks

**Advanced Stashing:**
- Partial stashing: `git stash -p` (interactive)
- Stash with message: `git stash save "work in progress"`
- Stash untracked files: `git stash -u`
- Create branch from stash: `git stash branch <branch-name>`

### Submodules and Subtrees

**Git Submodules:**
Allow you to include other Git repositories as subdirectories:

**Submodule Benefits:**
- Keep dependencies separate
- Pin to specific versions
- Independent development cycles

**Submodule Challenges:**
- Complex workflow
- Easy to create detached HEAD state
- Requires careful coordination

**Git Subtrees:**
Alternative to submodules that merges external repository into subdirectory:

**Subtree Benefits:**
- Simpler workflow than submodules
- No special commands for cloning
- History is preserved

**Subtree Challenges:**
- Larger repository size
- More complex to extract changes back to upstream

## ðŸ”¹ Git Hooks & Automation

### Understanding Git Hooks

**Git hooks** are scripts that run automatically at specific points in the Git workflow:

**Client-Side Hooks:**
- `pre-commit`: Runs before commit is created
- `prepare-commit-msg`: Runs before commit message editor
- `commit-msg`: Validates commit message format
- `post-commit`: Runs after commit is created
- `pre-push`: Runs before push to remote
- `post-checkout`: Runs after checkout
- `post-merge`: Runs after merge

**Server-Side Hooks:**
- `pre-receive`: Runs before any refs are updated
- `update`: Runs for each ref being updated
- `post-receive`: Runs after all refs are updated
- `post-update`: Runs after post-receive

### DevOps Hook Implementations

**Pre-Commit Hook Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run linting
echo "Running code linting..."
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Linting failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi

# Run tests
echo "Running tests..."
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi

# Check for secrets
echo "Scanning for secrets..."
git diff --cached --name-only | xargs grep -l "password\|secret\|key" && {
    echo "Potential secrets found. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
}

echo "Pre-commit checks passed."
```

**Commit Message Hook:**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/commit-msg

# Enforce conventional commit format
commit_regex='^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}'

if ! grep -qE "$commit_regex" "$1"; then
    echo "Invalid commit message format."
    echo "Format: type(scope): description"
    echo "Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Shared Hooks Management

**Challenges with Git Hooks:**
- Hooks are not version controlled
- Difficult to share across team
- Manual setup required for each clone

**Solutions:**

**1. Hook Templates:**
```bash
# Set up hook template directory
git config --global init.templateDir ~/.git-template

# Create template hooks
mkdir -p ~/.git-template/hooks
cp hooks/* ~/.git-template/hooks/
```

**2. Husky (Node.js projects):**
```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged",
      "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Pre-commit Framework:**
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files
```

## ðŸ”¹ DevOps Integration Patterns

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**Git-Centric CI/CD Workflows:**

**1. Branch-Based Deployments:**
- `main` branch â†’ Production environment
- `develop` branch â†’ Staging environment
- `feature/*` branches â†’ Review environments

**2. Tag-Based Releases:**
- Semantic versioning tags trigger releases
- Automated changelog generation
- Release artifact creation

**Example CI/CD Configuration:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
    tags: ['v*']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for proper analysis
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run test:coverage
      
      - name: SonarCloud Scan
        uses: SonarSource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}

  deploy-staging:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to staging environment"
          # Deployment commands

  deploy-production:
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to production environment"
          # Production deployment commands
```

### GitOps Methodology

**GitOps Principles:**
1. **Declarative**: System state described declaratively
2. **Versioned**: Configuration stored in Git
3. **Automated**: Changes applied automatically
4. **Monitored**: System continuously monitored for drift

**GitOps Workflow:**
```
Developer â†’ Git Repository â†’ CI Pipeline â†’ Container Registry
                â†“
Configuration Repository â†’ GitOps Operator â†’ Kubernetes Cluster
```

**Example GitOps Structure:**
```
gitops-repo/
â”œâ”€â”€ applications/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deployment.yaml
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service.yaml
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ kustomization.yaml
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ overlays/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ staging/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ production/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ monitoring/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ingress/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ storage/
â””â”€â”€ clusters/
    â”œâ”€â”€ staging/
    â””â”€â”€ production/
```

### Monorepo vs Polyrepo Strategies

**Monorepo Benefits:**
- Simplified dependency management
- Atomic cross-project changes
- Unified CI/CD pipeline
- Better code sharing and reuse

**Monorepo Challenges:**
- Larger repository size
- Complex build systems
- Potential for tight coupling
- Scaling CI/CD pipelines

**Polyrepo Benefits:**
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Independent release cycles
- Smaller, focused repositories
- Technology diversity

**Polyrepo Challenges:**
- Dependency management complexity
- Cross-repository changes
- Code duplication

## ðŸ”¹ Security & Best Practices

### Commit Signing and Verification

**GPG Commit Signing:**
Ensures commit authenticity and integrity:

```bash
# Generate GPG key
gpg --full-generate-key

# List GPG keys
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG

# Configure Git to use GPG key
git config --global user.signingkey <key-id>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# Sign commits
git commit -S -m "Signed commit"

# Verify signatures
git log --show-signature
```

**SSH Commit Signing (Git 2.34+):**
```bash
# Configure SSH signing
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

### Secrets Management

**Preventing Secret Commits:**

**1. Pre-commit Hooks:**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Check for common secret patterns
if git diff --cached | grep -E "(password|secret|key|token)" | grep -v "example"; then
    echo "Potential secret detected!"
    exit 1
fi
```

**2. Git-secrets Tool:**
```bash
# Install git-secrets
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws
git secrets --scan
```

**3. .gitignore Best Practices:**
```gitignore
# Environment files
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Build artifacts
dist/
build/
node_modules/

# Logs
*.log
logs/

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.temp
```

### Repository Security Policies

**Branch Protection Rules:**
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks
- Require up-to-date branches
- Restrict force pushes
- Require signed commits

**Access Control:**
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Use of teams and groups
- Audit logging

**Vulnerability Scanning:**
- Dependency scanning
- Secret scanning
- Code quality analysis
- License compliance

## ðŸ”¹ Troubleshooting & Recovery

### Common Git Problems and Solutions

**1. Detached HEAD State:**
```bash
# Problem: Checked out specific commit, now in detached HEAD
# Solution: Create branch or return to existing branch
git checkout -b new-branch-name  # Create branch from current state
git checkout main                # Return to main branch
```

**2. Merge Conflicts:**
```bash
# Problem: Automatic merge failed due to conflicts
# Solution: Resolve conflicts manually
git status                       # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .                        # Stage resolved files
git commit                       # Complete merge
```

**3. Accidentally Committed to Wrong Branch:**
```bash
# Problem: Made commits on main instead of feature branch
# Solution: Move commits to correct branch
git branch feature-branch        # Create branch with current commits
git reset --hard HEAD~3          # Reset main branch (3 commits back)
git checkout feature-branch      # Switch to feature branch
```

**4. Lost Commits:**
```bash
# Problem: Commits seem to have disappeared
# Solution: Use reflog to find lost commits
git reflog                       # Show reference log
git checkout <commit-hash>       # Checkout lost commit
git branch recovery-branch       # Create branch to save commits
```

### Advanced Recovery Techniques

**Using Git Reflog:**
Git reflog tracks all reference updates, providing a safety net:

```bash
# View reflog
git reflog

# Reflog for specific branch
git reflog show main

# Recover from reflog
git reset --hard HEAD@{2}
```

**Repository Corruption Recovery:**
```bash
# Check repository integrity
git fsck --full

# Recover from backup
git clone --mirror <backup-url> .git

# Rebuild index
rm .git/index
git reset
```

**Partial File Recovery:**
```bash
# Recover deleted file from specific commit
git checkout <commit-hash> -- path/to/file

# Recover file from stash
git checkout stash@{0} -- path/to/file

# Show file content from specific commit
git show <commit-hash>:path/to/file
```

### Performance Optimization

**Large Repository Management:**

**1. Shallow Clones:**
```bash
# Clone with limited history
git clone --depth 1 <repository-url>

# Deepen shallow clone
git fetch --unshallow
```

**2. Sparse Checkout:**
```bash
# Enable sparse checkout
git config core.sparseCheckout true
echo "src/" > .git/info/sparse-checkout
git read-tree -m -u HEAD
```

**3. Git LFS (Large File Storage):**
```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track large files
git lfs track "*.psd"
git lfs track "*.zip"

# Add .gitattributes
git add .gitattributes
```

**4. Repository Maintenance:**
```bash
# Optimize repository
git gc --aggressive --prune=now

# Repack objects
git repack -ad

# Clean up unreachable objects
git prune
```
